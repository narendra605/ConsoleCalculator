# Console Calculator - Java Internship Task 1 

## Overview
This project is a **Java console-based calculator** developed for the Java Developer Internship Task 1.  
It performs basic arithmetic operations — **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** — while demonstrating fundamental **Java programming concepts**.

The program leverages:

- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**  
- **Methods**  
- **Conditionals**  
- **Loops**  
- **Input/Output (I/O)**  
- **Exception Handling**

---

## Features
- Supports arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.  
- Continuous calculations until the user types `exit`.  
- Graceful handling of **divide-by-zero**.  
- Input validation using **exception handling** to manage non-numeric inputs.  
- Clean **OOP structure** with two classes:  
  1. `CalculatorOperations` – Handles all arithmetic operations.  
  2. `Calculator` – Main class handling user interaction and control flow.

## How to Run
1. 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/narendra605/ConsoleCalculator.git
2. Open the project in Eclipse or any Java IDE.
3.Run the Calculator.java file.
4.Follow the console prompts to perform calculations.
5.Type exit to quit the program.

##Demo
A demonstration of the calculator in action can be viewed here:

##Concepts Used

1.OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

Separation of concerns using two classes (CalculatorOperations and Calculator).

Encapsulation of arithmetic logic in a dedicated operations class.

2.Methods

Each arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) is implemented as a separate method.

3.Conditionals

if-else statements are used to determine the operation selected by the user.

Input validation ensures correct operation and numeric input.

4.Loops

while loop allows the program to continue running until the user decides to exit.

5.Input/Output (I/O)

Scanner class is used to read user input from the console.

6.Exception Handling

try-catch blocks manage invalid numeric input (InputMismatchException).

Divide-by-zero is handled gracefully with error messages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/narendra605/ConsoleCalculator.git
